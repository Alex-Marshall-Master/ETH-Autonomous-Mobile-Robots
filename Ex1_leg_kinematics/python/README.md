# Exercise 1 - Kinematics of a robotic leg 

## Python code

You are initially provided with the (incomplete) `Ex1.py` file. Completed answers can be found in `Ex1_answers.py` once released.

To run: navigate to the directory, install the requirements, and then run the script. Extra functionality such as plotting are already implemented in the `Ex1_extras.py` file, and should not need to be modified (though of course you are welcome to experiment).


```
cd /path/to/ex1_leg_kinematics/python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 Ex1_answers.py
```
